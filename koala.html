                <h3>KOALA</h3>
                <p>The koala or, inaccurately, koala bear (Phascolarctos cinereus) is an arboreal herbivorous marsupial native to Australia. It is the only extant representative of the family Phascolarctidae and its closest living relatives are the wombats, which are members of the family Vombatidae. The koala is found in coastal areas of the mainland's eastern and southern regions, inhabiting Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, and South Australia. It is easily recognisable by its stout, tailless body and large head with round, fluffy ears and large spoonshape nose.</p>
                <p>Koalas have the thickest fur of all marsupials. It looks like it would be soft to touch, but it is actually coarse. Their fur can be grey or brown. The koalas in the south usually have thicker and darker fur than the koalas in the north. Social behavior. Koalas are primarily solitary animals. There will usually only be one koala per tree.</p>
                <p>Koalas are 2 to 3 feet (60 to 85 centimeters) tall when fully grown. Their weight varies, depending on where the koala lives. Northern koalas weigh around 9 to 19 lbs. (4 to 8.5 kilograms) and southern koalas weigh around 15 to 29 lbs. (7 to 13 kg). Typically, males weigh 50 percent more than females, according to San Diego Zoo.Koalas range in color from slate gray to reddish brown, according to Sea World</p>
                <p>The word koala comes from the Dharug gula, meaning no water. It was at one time thought, since the animals were not observed to come down from trees often, that they were able to survive without drinking. The leaves of the eucalyptus tree have a high water content, so the koala does not need to drink often. But the notion that they do not need to drink water at all was shown to be a myth.</p>
