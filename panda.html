                <h3>PANDA</h3>
                <p>The giant panda, also known as the panda bear or simply the panda, is a bear native to south central China. It is characterised by large, black patches around its eyes, over the ears, and across its round body. The name "giant panda" is sometimes used to distinguish it from the red panda, a neighboring musteloid. Though it belongs to the order Carnivora, the giant panda is a folivore, with bamboo shoots and leaves making up more than 99% of its diet. Giant pandas in the wild will occasionally eat other grasses, wild tubers, or even meat in the form of birds, rodents, or carrion. In captivity, they may receive honey, eggs, fish, yams, shrub leaves, oranges, or bananas along with specially prepared food</p>
                <p>A group of pandas is known as an embarrassment. Pandas live most of their lives alone, but small groups of pandas may share large feeding territories. Giant pandas are the more commonly known type of panda. They have black fur on their ears, around their eyes, muzzle, legs and shoulders. Giant pandas eat 20 to 45 pounds of bamboo shoots a day.</p>
                <p>In the past, pandas were thought to be rare and noble creatures â€“ the Empress Dowager Bo was buried with a panda skull in her vault. The grandson of Emperor Taizong of Tang is said to have given Japan two pandas and a sheet of panda skin as a sign of goodwill. Unlike many other animals in Ancient China, pandas were rarely thought to have medical uses. The few known uses include the Sichuan tribal peoples' use of panda urine to melt accidentally swallowed needles, and the use of panda pelts to control menses.Giant panda, bearlike mammal inhabiting bamboo forests in the mountains of central China.
