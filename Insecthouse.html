                <h3>INSECT HOUSE</h3>
                <p>Insects and other bugs and minibeasts are an important and fascinating part of the wildlife in our gardens and they make their homes in all sorts of places. We can grow the flowers for bees, build bug hotels and much more. Get a few stronger members of the team to put the pallets and heavy items in place, then invite everyone else, including kids, to stuff the other materials into the holes.   </p>
                <p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM?</p>
                <p>Come and visit the insect homes at the Eden Project for inspiration; they’re next to our big ‘Hive’ building at the centre of the site.</p>
